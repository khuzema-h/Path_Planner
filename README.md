# ENPM 661 Project 2: BFS Path Planner for a Point Robot
## About
This Project involves a Point Robot in an Enivonment with obstacles, and it must navigate from a start point to a goal point and find the optimal path using the BFS (Breadth First Search) Algorithm. The obstacles in the environment are formed using Semi Algebraic Inequalities and Half Planes

## Dependencies
Ensure you have the following Dependencies in order to run the code
- Python 3
- Matplotlib
- Opencv (cv2)
- Numpy

## Running the Code 
- Run the file names **BFS_khuzema_habib.py**
- The program will prompt the user to enter the Start and Goal Coordinates.
- The program will ask the user to re-enter the coordinates if the entered coordinates are on an obstacle or out of bounds
- The program then prints the time taken to find the path in the terminal console and displays an image of the path taken as well as the searched area
- A video file of the animation is saved as 'bfs_path_planner.mp4'
